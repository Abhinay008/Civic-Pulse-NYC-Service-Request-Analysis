# Civic-Pulse-NYC-Service-Request-Analysis

Project Objective
To analyze 750,000+ public service requests from Q1 2024 to identify key civic issues, measure city-wide response effectiveness, and find operational hotspots.

Tech Stack
Data Cleaning & Transformation: Python (Pandas)

Database: SQLite

Data Analysis: SQL

Visualization: Power BI (connected live to the SQLite database)

Key Findings & Insights
Top Complaints: Illegal Parking and lack of Heat/Hot Water are the dominant citizen pain points.

Agency Workload: The NYPD and Department of Housing (HPD) are the front lines, handling over 70% of all incoming requests.

Performance Baseline: The city's average time to resolve a complaint is 2.3 days.

Geographic Hotspots: Brooklyn and Queens are the epicenters, accounting for more than 50% of all service requests.

The Final Dashboard Here is a image link of the interactive dashboard I built in Power BI to visualize these findings. Each chart is powered by a direct SQL query to the database.
